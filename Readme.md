### 🎮 Game Prompt – **Gaslighted**

Build a 2D satire game in **React + TypeScript**. The player (Wojak) is stuck in a corporate google-meet-like meeting and can’t mute. A **fart pressure meter** builds during the call. They must **release pressure discreetly** by clicking karaoke-style letters, timed with character speech (via **Amazon Polly viseme metadata**).

---

### 🧱 Core Systems

#### UI
- ui should be as close as possible to google meet, for example hangout will just quit te game return the main menu, non relveant buttons should be disabled. (simulating a bug)
- should have a karaoke text for the current dialogue highlighting the current word, with the letter (related to the fart) to press above.
- farting release UI effects
- should shiny effects with combos etc like guitar hero

#### 🔺 Fart Pressure (can go **negative**)
- Starts at `0`, increases over time
- Reduced by timed releases
- Can go **below 0** — this becomes the **final score**
- Max = **auto fart**

#### 🔻 Shame Meter (0–100)
- Increases on:
  - OK fart = low shame
  - Missed/Bad fart = high shame
- Full = **game over (player resigns)**

#### 🎯 Combo System
- Consecutive perfect farts = combo
- Combo rewards:
  - Extra pressure relief
  - Bonus score
  - Visual/audio effects
- Any mistake = combo break

#### 💨 Fart Types (6 MP3s)
- Mapped to viseme phoneme types (`t`, `p`, `b`, `f`, `r`, `z`)
- Each triggers:
  - A specific sound (`fart1.mp3` to `fart6.mp3`)
  - Matching NPC reaction (face change, sound, camera FX)
  - the fart sound volume should be louder than the dialogue when it' bad and lower when it's okay, and silent when it's perfect.

---

### 📘 Level Completion

- A level ends **when all dialogue lines are finished**
- Victory condition:
  - Reached the end of the meeting
- Final score = **negative pressure value** (lower is better)

### 👥 Characters

- **wojak** (player)
- **zoomer**
- **boomer**
- **karen**

Each character has:
```
[id]-talking1.png
[id]-talking2.png
[id]-neutral.png
[id]-perfect-fart-reaction.png
[id]-okay-fart-reaction.png
[id]-bad-fart-reaction.png
...
```

Stored in: `/assets/faces/`

🗣️ Characters must:
- Animate between talking1, talking2, neutral talking1 ... while speaking.
- React with different expressions to each fart type:
  - perfect (no reaction)
  - okay
  - bad
- the player character (wojak) must also react to the fart sound and has more expressions. depending on pressure build up, loosing with max shame, wining, having a silent fart etc.

    okay: 15
    bad: 100
  shame_gain:
    perfect: 0
    okay: 10
    bad: 40
